- 👋 Hi there, Vikas from Germany! 🇩🇪
- 👀  I'm fueled by data, fueled by food, and fueled by climbing mountains (figuratively... mostly). ‍♂️
- 🌱 Currently mastering the art of Data Structures and Algorithms, one sleepless night at a time.
- 💻 Programming languages: Java, Python, R, and LaTeX. (Bit of a polyglot there)
- 🗣  Languages : English(C2+), German(B1), Hindi & Bengali(Native fluency)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analysis Projects 
- 📫 Hit me up at vikas.singh56655@gmail.com if you're down to code and chow down.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Lego minifigs outnumber actual humans on Earth.  (Don't worry, I'm still real... I think.)
